# Amazon Data Analysis: End-to-End SQL + Python Project

## Project Overview

This project is an end-to-end data analysis solution aimed at extracting valuable business insights from Amazon sales data. We leverage Python for data cleaning, exploration, and visualization, while SQL is used for advanced querying to drive key decisions. The analysis covers various aspects, including sales performance, discount strategies, customer behavior, and product trends. This project is perfect for data analysts looking to enhance their skills in data manipulation, SQL querying, and building end-to-end data pipelines for business intelligence.

## Project Steps

### 1. Set Up the Environment
   - **Tools Used**: Visual Studio Code (VS Code), Python, SQL (MySQL)
   - **Goal**: Create a structured workspace within VS Code and organize project folders for smooth development and data handling.

### 2. Set Up Kaggle API
   - **API Setup**: Obtain your Kaggle API token from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/) by navigating to your profile settings and downloading the JSON file.
   - **Configure Kaggle**: 
      - Place the downloaded `kaggle.json` file in your local `.kaggle` folder.
      - Use the command `kaggle datasets download -d <dataset-path>` to pull datasets directly into your project.

### 3. Download Walmart Sales Data
   - **Data Source**: Use the Kaggle API to download the Walmart sales datasets from Kaggle.
   - **Dataset Link**: [Amazon Sales Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/karkavelrajaj/amazon-sales-dataset/data)
   - **Storage**: Save the data in the `data/` folder for easy reference and access.

### 4. Install Required Libraries and Load Data
   - **Libraries**: Install necessary Python libraries using:
     ```bash
     pip install pandas numpy sqlalchemy mysql-connector-python
     ```
   - **Loading Data**: Read the data into a Pandas DataFrame for initial analysis and transformations.

### 5. Explore the Data
   - **Goal**: Conduct an initial data exploration to understand data distribution, check column names, types, and identify potential issues.
   - **Analysis**: Use functions like `.info()`, `.describe()`, and `.head()` to get a quick overview of the data structure and statistics.

### 6. Data Cleaning
   - **Remove Duplicates**: Identify and remove duplicate entries to avoid skewed results.
   - **Handle Missing Values**: Drop rows or columns with missing values if they are insignificant; fill values where essential.
   - **Currency Formatting**: Use `.replace()` to handle and format currency values for analysis.
   - **Validation**: Check for any remaining inconsistencies and verify the cleaned data.

### 7. Feature Engineering
   - **Create New Columns**: Calculate the `Total Amount` for each transaction by multiplying `unit_price` by `quantity` and adding this as a new column.
   - **Enhance Dataset**: Adding this calculated field will streamline further SQL analysis and aggregation tasks.

### 8. Load Data into MySQL 
   - **Set Up Connections**: Connect to MySQL  using `sqlalchemy` and load the cleaned data into each database.
   - **Table Creation**: Set up tables in MySQL using Python SQLAlchemy to automate table creation and data insertion.
   - **Verification**: Run initial SQL queries to confirm that the data has been loaded accurately.

### 9. SQL Analysis: Complex Queries and Business Problem Solving
   - **Business Problem-Solving**: Write and execute advanced SQL queries to answer essential business questions, such as:
     - Identifying top-selling products and categories based on sales performance.
     - Analyzing the relationship between product pricing, discount percentages, and ratings.
     - Identifying the most popular customer review trends and user feedback.
     - Understanding customer behavior by analyzing review patterns, ratings, and product preferences.
   - **Documentation**: provide clear explanations for each query, outlining its objective, methodology, and key insights, ensuring transparency and reproducibility in the analysis.
### 10. Project Publishing and Documentation
   - **Documentation**: Maintain well-structured documentation of the entire process in Markdown or a Jupyter Notebook.
   - **Project Publishing**: Publish the completed project on GitHub or any other version control platform, including:
     - The `README.md` file (this document).
     - Jupyter Notebooks (if applicable).
     - SQL query scripts.
     - Data files (if possible) or steps to access them.
